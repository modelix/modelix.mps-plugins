/**
 * A token to pass around signaling that a certain item is already synchronized to Modelix.
 *
 * E.g. Modules A and B depend on Module C and none of them are synchronized to Modelix yet. When we synchronize them
 * then Module A and B are synced in parallel, so one of them will sync Module C first and the other will see that
 * the Module is already on the server. However, in this case it is not an error, because we were expected to sync
 * Module C to the server. So in this case Module A just creates this token to let the sync flow know that Module C
 * does not have to be synced again.
